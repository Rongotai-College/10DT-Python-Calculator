### The Design
* Colour
  * The colours I have chosen for the calculator is taken from my design for the age group.
  * The **website** that I used for this is: [**w3schools**](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp)
    
* Layout
  * Here's a link to my design in **Miro**: [miro.com](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPLluMV4=/) 
  * This is the layout of the calculator in **Tkinter**.
